      <h2>Part 1</h2>
      <p>Create a webpage that contains the heading Student Grades, and inputs a
        student's homework average, mid-term exam score, final exam score, and
        participation (all those grades will be entered as integers). Create a script
        that checks for valid input, i.e., that the input is between 0-100 and that,
        of course, the input are all numbers. If all input is valid then calculate and
        display the student's final average according to the formula:
        <br>
        final average = (.5 * hwAvg) + (.2 * midExam) + (.2 * finalExam) + (.1 * participation)

      <h2>Part 3</h2>
      <p>Create a web page using input boxes that will calculate the conversion
        from Celsius to Farenheit (C to F) or the conversion to Farenheit to
        Celsius (F to C) according to the formulas below:
        <br>
        C = 5/9 * (F - 32)
        <br>
        F = (9/5 * C) + 32
