    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>Create a webpage containing a form that displays an input text box, a group of radio buttons, a group
        of checkboxes, and select items (a drop-down or datalist element); along with a script that executes
        form validation.
        <br>
        Your script should validate whether the user has entered data in the input text box, has checked a
        radio button, has checked at least one checkbox, and has selected an option from the list of options in
        the select (or datalist) element.
        <br>
        <br>
        Use a submit button to invoke the validation script, so that the form is processed only when the form
        fields are ALL valid. If a field is invalid then display a message to the user.

        <h2>Part 2 & 3</h2>
        <p>Create a 2nd webpage that contains a script that utilizes 2 pulldown menus. The first one should
            utilize an onchange event handler. The second should utilize a button with an onclick event handler to
            navigate to a page after an option is selected. Each pulldown menu should include at least 3 URL
            destinations. The website should open in another tab/window so the user does not need to use the
            back button of the browser to go back to Part 2 page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Given the following table of data about several of our states from the July/2019 census, create a
            webpage that enables the user to enter a state name (full or just the two characters that represent the
            state) and have the State Name, State Capital, and population appear in separate input box or
            textarea. DO NOT USE ALERT!!!
