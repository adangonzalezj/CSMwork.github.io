    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>Create a webpage in which users are allowed to select a page layout and formatting through the use of the className property. 
      Choose at least three form elements such as: radio buttons, select items, checkboxes, and buttons to allow the user to change some CSS property of the page 
      - for example: a group of radio buttons for the user to select background color, a select item for the user to select font size or group of font family, 
      a group of checkboxes where the user can select italic (font style), bold (font weight), etc.

    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <p>Write a script that will save two cookies for the same page - one for the name of the user and another one for the username of the user. Both cookies 
      should be deleted when the user closes the browser.If it is the first time the user is opening the page on the browser, you will present a form for the user 
      to type his/her name and his/her username. If the user is revisiting the page while the browser is still opened, you will just display a message of Welcome 
      Back followed by the name of the user that you will retrieve from the cookie previously saved.
